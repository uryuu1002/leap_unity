      <p> This video clip shows my working process of my final project
      </p>
      <p> when I first accessed Unity and Leap Motion at the same time.
         </p>
      <p> Through online tutorials and the premade Unity Leap Motion
          </p>
      <p> core assets, I was able to create simple objects and environments
          </p>
      <p> that allows my hand to be detected and interacted with my object
          </p>
      <p> creations. Rigidbody, gravity, collision components, along with
          </p>
      <p>
          interactive behavior script, my hands were able to interact with
          </p>
      <p> the virtual world within Unity.
