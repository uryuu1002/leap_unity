      <p> LEAP MOTION is a computer hardware sensor device that “supports hand and
      </p>
      <p> finger motions as input, analogous to a mouse, but requires no hand
      </p>
      <p>contact or touching.”

      <p> This video clip shows my working process of my final project when I first 
      </p>
      <p> accessed Unity and Leap Motion at the same time.Through online tutorials 
      </p>
      <p> and the premade Unity Leap Motioncore assets, I was able to create simple
      </p>
      <p> objects and environmentsthat allows my hand to be detected and interacted
      </p>
      <p> with my object creations. Rigidbody, gravity, collision components, along 
      </p>
      <p> with interactive behavior script, my hands were able to interact with the 
      </p>
      <p> virtual world within Unity.
